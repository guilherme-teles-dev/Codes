However, there is a common problem of imbalanced distribution in real datasets, which directly affects the prediction accuracy of regression models. In order to solve the problem of data imbalance regression, considering the continuity of the target value and the correlation of the data and using the idea of optimization and confrontation, we propose an IRGAN (imbalanced regres...",

Interstate rivalry has been shown to shape a wide range of global patterns. This paper examines the intersection between these two important phenomena. It builds upon previous scholarship by developing a broader and more nuanced theory of the rivalry-cyber operation relationship and testing it empirically with newly developed data on cyber o...",

Yet the general reaction of scholars of international relations has been to neglect the cyber peril owing to its technical novelties and intricacies. This attitude amounts to either one or both of two claims: the problem is not of sufficient scale to warrant close inspection, or it is not comprehensible to a non-technical observer. This seminar challenged both assertions.",

We replace the original VGG16 with a more compact MobileNet to obtain a much smaller SSD model for face detection, and use a traditional 2-D face key point detection to obtain an aligned face image. In face representation, we re-train the SphereFace using FP16 instead of FP32 to further reduce resource consumption. We then build the face detection and face representation modules on a Movidius NCS2 device for ac...",
